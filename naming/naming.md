 - Why is etcd called etcd in kubernetes?
   
   The etc in etcd refers to /etc directory in unix file system. The etc directory stores configuration files(initially meant for all miscellaneous configuration files). The d stands for "distributed" because etcd is designed as a distributed key value store.
