 - Authentication vs Authorization
    - Mnemonic to remember this: **ID gets you In, Rights get you the Room.**
    - ID sounds somewhat similar to authenTIcation, Rights sounds somewhat similar to authoRIZation. Not exactly, but enough to associate the words in mnemonic to the actual words.
    - Visualise like this: Imagine trying to enter a fancy nightclub. The bouncer at the door asks for your ID. If your ID is valid, he lets you inside. Once inside the club, you notice there are different areas: general admission, VIP lounge, or backstage. Your wristband or stamp (Rights) dictates where you can go inside. Only those with VIP access can enter the lounge, while general admission stays on the main floor.
    - Of course this is mostly useful when you already know the concepts and you are just confused about which is which.
