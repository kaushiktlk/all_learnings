 - Authentication vs Authorization
    - Mnemonic to remember this: **ID gets you In, Rights get you the Room.**
    - ID sounds somewhat similar to authenTIcation, Rights sounds somewhat similar to authoRIZation. Not exactly, but enough to associate the words in mnemonic to the actual words.
    - Visualise like this: Imagine trying to enter a fancy nightclub. The bouncer at the door asks for your ID. If your ID is valid, he lets you inside. Once inside the club, you notice there are different areas: general admission, VIP lounge, or backstage. Your wristband or stamp (Rights) dictates where you can go inside. Only those with VIP access can enter the lounge, while general admission stays on the main floor.
    - Of course this is mostly useful when you already know the concepts and you are just confused about which is which.
    - Authentication: The process of verifying the identity of a user or system, ensuring that the individual or entity is who they claim to be. This typically involves validating credentials such as passwords, biometrics, or tokens.
    - Authorization: The process of determining and granting permissions to a user or system to access specific resources or perform certain actions. This occurs after authentication and defines what the authenticated user is allowed to do.
