# Core Java notes

 - **JRE:** Contains JVM, core libraries, and other files required to run Java programs.
 - **JDK:** Contains JRE, compilers (javac), debuggers, and tools for developing Java apps.
 - Java automatically casts an integer to a string when concatenating a string and an integer. This behavior is due to the way Java handles the + operator when one of the operands is a string.
